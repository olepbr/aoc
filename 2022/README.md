# 2022

This year I went with Perl as my programming language of choice. Yes, you read
that correctly: Perl. Christmas is the time for miracles, after all.

## Prerequisites

The code asssumes Perl version 5.32 or higher; 5.32 is included in the current
Debian stable (bullseye), so if you have an older version, well, I'm not sure
what to tell you. :–)

This gives us some niceties: `say()` instead of `print()`, strictures enabled by
default, and… that's about it. Once we get to 5.36 we won't have to enable
warnings ourselves and – last but not least – will be able to write function
signatures!
